I wanted to recreate a game I've been addicted to for the past 2-3 weeks. I think I did a great job replicating some of the key mechanics. While certain mechanics could have been structured better, what matters most is the end result. There's still a bug where the top bar doesn't update the levels when transitioning between levelsâ€”I plan to fix that and update it here when I have the time. In this game, the difficulty increases every 20 levels until level 100. Beyond level 100, the difficulty stays the same, but the patterns become highly random to keep the later levels challenging.
